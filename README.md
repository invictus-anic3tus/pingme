# How to use PingMe

PingMe is built on simplicity. When you open the app for the first time, you'll see the Home tab. There'll be an "Add Ping" button, which you can click to redirect you to the Add Ping tab. Fill out the info for your ping, such as name, description, ping date, and whether it repeats. Click "Done" on the bottom, and you'll see it in your home! You can edit it at any time by hitting the edit icon at it's top right, and you can complete, delete, and delay it if you wish.

There are also settings! The "General" tab doesn't have a lot for now, but you can delete all of your data if you wish. There's the "Appearance" tab, where you can change the theme and swap between light and dark. (There's also a light/dark button below the tabs on the left!) You can download the Mobile App in the next tab, and learn some about me in the last tab.
